    <h2>Neal Doying</h2>
    <p>Hello World!  My name is Neal.<br>
        I am working on the Software Programming/Web<br> 
        Development certificate.  I donâ€™t know what I will <br>
        do after the first certificate as I already have <br>
        a career but we shall see.  I think I can use computer <br>
        programming in my current work in investment management <br>
        and looking forward to learning more.<br>
    </p>
        
    <p>I am married with two children and two grandchildren.<br>  
        I enjoy spending time with my family.<br>  
        In addition, I enjoying cycling, kayaking <br>
        and playing the guitar and writing songs. <br> 
        And I am an avid reader but that has been <br>
        the thing I have sacrificed (some) to fit in <br>
        my Pathway Worldwide studies.<br>
    </p>
        
    <p>I have owned a domain name for a couple of decades <br>
        but only use it for email addresses.  Maybe I will learn <br>
        enough to actually pay for a hosting service and design a <br>
        website.  But first I need to learn and then I need to <br>
        decide what kind of website to design.<br>
    </p>
        
    <p>I have been a member of the church all my life, <br>
        my parents were converts when I was a young pre-schooler.  <br>
        I am currently teaching the 17/18 year old Sunday School <br>
        class and love learning about Jesus Christ and the New Testament.<br>
    </p>
        
    <p>That is all for now.</p>
