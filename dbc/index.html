            <p>Birding helps you connect with nature – there are over 380 bird species in Connecticut and approximately 10,000 across the world. They come in many sizes and shape with unique colors and habits. Observing how they interact with the world around them and other animals helps us appreciate the beauty and complexity of nature and our role in nature and the world around us. </p>

            <p>Birding is good for your health (physical, mental and emotional) – getting out to observe birds brings us health benefits from being outside and walking. Using our mental faculties to watch and listen and remember minute details keeps us mentally active. Observing how birds interact with their environment helps us appreciate the balance that nature provides and can bring emotional balance to our lives as well. </p>
