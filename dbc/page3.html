            <p><span class="bold-text">July 15th – Darien Birders Club Monthly Outing:</span> On the third Saturday of each month we meet for an outdoor bird watching excursion.  This month we will be meeting at Selleck’s Woods Nature Preserve in Darien, a 28 acre nature preserve located between I-95 and Metro-North railroad.  There are three entrances, we will meet at the Parkland’s Drive entrance where there is parking available.  We will meet at 7:30am and plan for 90 minutes of bird watching.  This outing will be followed by an informal gathering at Dunkin on Post Road for a donut and to compare notes.  Hope to see you there.</p>

            <p><span class="bold-text">June – Darien Birders Club Monthly Outing Report:</span>  Twenty-five members and friends met at Cove Beach North Park in Stamford on June 17.  Although the day was overcast we spotted several water fowl including Snowy Egrets, Common Terns, Bufflehead and Hooded Merganser ducks.  Our June outing is also our volunteer event and we collected three bags of trash in our efforts to beautify the area and provider a cleaner and safer habitat for our feathered friends.  Thank you to all who participated.</p>

            <p><span class="bold-text">August 26th – <a href = "https://greenwich.audubon.org/events/hawk-watch-kickoff-intro-hawk-id"> Hawk Watch Kickoff & Intro to Hawk ID at the Greenwich Audubon Center.</a></span>  This is one of the signature local events for raptor watching.  On average 20,000 raptors migrate over Quaker Ridge every fall.  This is a great event to learn how to identify hawks, eagles, falcons and vultures in flight.  Tickets are required for the kickoff event (see the above link for details).  In addition volunteers can assist with the official hawk counters every day from August 25th to November 30th 9am to 5pm.</p>
