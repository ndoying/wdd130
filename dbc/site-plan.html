        Why Become a Birder: The first page will introduce people to the Darien Birders Club and to the benefits of bird watching.  Among the many benefits are: 
        1. Birding helps you connect with nature – there are over 380 bird species in Connecticut and approximately 10,000 across the world.  They come in many sizes and shape with unique colors and habits.  Observing how they interact with the world around them and other animals helps us appreciate the beauty and complexity of nature and our role in nature and the world around us.
        2. Birding is good for your health (physical, mental and emotional) – getting out to observe birds brings us health benefits from being outside and walking.  Using our mental faculties to watch and listen and remember minute details keeps us mentally active.  Observing how birds interact with their environment helps us appreciate the balance that nature provides and can bring emotional balance to our lives as well.
        3. Birding helps you make friends – participating in monthly outings and other events helps us make connections within our community and neighborhoods and develop supporting relationships based on common interests.

      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>
        Getting Started: The second page will focus on getting started and include three sections: 
        1. A description of the Cornell Lab Merlin bird ID app, how it helps you identify birds, record your sightings and download regional information.  Also include a link to the app site; 
        2. A brief description of what to look for in purchasing a pair of binoculars with a short list of top rated affordable options; 
        3.  A list of places to go for birding:
          1.	Greenwich Point Park: Located in Greenwich, this park provides a variety of habitats, including sandy beaches, grassy areas, and woodlands, attracting a wide range of bird species.
          2.	Sherwood Island State Park: Situated in Westport, Sherwood Island is Connecticut's oldest state park. Its diverse ecosystems, including salt marshes, woodlands, and beaches, attract numerous bird species throughout the year.
          3.	Audubon Greenwich: This sanctuary in Greenwich features trails that wind through woodlands, meadows, and wetlands, offering excellent birdwatching opportunities. They also organize bird walks and educational programs.
          4.	Silvermine-Fowler Preserve: Found in New Canaan, this preserve offers trails that meander through a mix of habitats, including woodlands, wetlands, and open fields, attracting a diverse bird population.
          5.	Birdcraft Museum and Sanctuary: Located in Fairfield, Birdcraft is the oldest private bird sanctuary in the United States. It features gardens and woodlands that provide an inviting environment for birdwatching.

        and a challenge to identify the 10 most common backyard birds in our Connecticut community.

      <h3>Events</h3>
      <p>
        Upcoming and Past Events: The third page will list upcoming events highlighting the club’s monthly outing where we meet the second Wednesday of the month at a birding site for an hour walk and post-walk visit to the donut shop.  This will include a section with a brief re-cap of the previous month’s outing and a list of bird seen.  Other activities listed will include any upcoming speaker series events and the Greenwich Audubon Center’s Annual Fall Festival and Hawk Watch where families can come to learn more about nature and volunteer to participate in the Center’s raptor migration census.
